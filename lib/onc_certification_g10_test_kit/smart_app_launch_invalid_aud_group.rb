      # Background

      The Invalid AUD Sequence verifies that a SMART Launch Sequence,
      specifically the [Standalone
      Launch](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/index.html#standalone-launch-sequence)
      Sequence, does not work in the case where the client sends an invalid FHIR
      server as the `aud` parameter during launch. This must fail to ensure that
      a genuine bearer token is not leaked to a counterfit resource server.

      This test is not included as part of a regular SMART Launch Sequence
      because it requires the browser of the user to be redirected to the
      authorization service, and there is no expectation that the authorization
      service redirects the user back to Inferno with an error message. The only
      requirement is that Inferno is not granted a code to exchange for a valid
      access token. Since this is a special case, it is tested independently in
      a separate sequence.

      Note that this test will launch a new browser window. The user is required
      to 'Attest' in the Inferno user interface after the launch does not
      succeed, if the server does not return an error code.
